# UK# Keyboard

This is a mac keyboard layout file for UK keyboards which replaces the top left `Â±` key
with the `#` key.

## Why?

As a programmer I mash the hash key what seems like thousands of times a day
so having to press `alt+3` seems like twice the work.

I created this keyboard layout when I came over from PC's in 2006 and copied to
every new mac since. Until recently UK keyboards didn't even have `#` symbol
displayed, so many new uk mac users would google for this, hopefully this'll
help other mac programmers who also hate unnessary the `alt+3` key combo.
